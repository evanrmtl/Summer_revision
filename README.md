## Summer AI Learning & Revision Program

This repository documents my personal journey of reviewing and deepening my understanding of Artificial Intelligence throughout the summer. The goal is to strengthen my foundations in mathematics, machine learning, and deep learning, while also exploring new concepts and practical implementations.

Each week is structured around specific themes, combining theory, hands-on projects, and reflection.

You'll find notes, mini-projects, experiments, and resources I’ve used to guide my progress. The focus is on learning through doing — building intuition, solving real problems, and staying consistent.
